## Status and Custom Tags

Your TailorTalk agent can track lead statuses such as **Converted, Hot, Warm, Cold, and Dead**. Each status has a predefined meaning, but you can also customize them to better match your business needs.

- **Custom Definitions:** You can update how each lead status is defined based on your sales process.
- **Manual Tags:** These allow you to tag leads manually for better tracking and segmentation. For instance, you can create tags like `Needs Demo` or `Budget Constraint`. These tags help your team filter and prioritize leads accordingly.

## Lead Escalation Management

Escalation settings allow you to decide when a lead should be escalated to a human. This ensures that critical leads requiring personal intervention don't get stuck in automation.

- **Defining Escalation Triggers:** You can instruct the agent to escalate when a lead explicitly asks to talk to a human or if their queries go beyond what the AI can handle.

- **Escalation Summary:** You can specify the type of summary the agent should generate at the time of escalation. This helps the human agent quickly understand the context without reading the entire chat history.
- **Admin WhatsApp Number:** You can provide a WhatsApp number where the escalation summary should be sent. This ensures that a team member is immediately notified.
- **Locking Escalated Leads:** When you enable this option, the agent will no longer respond to the lead after escalation. This prevents duplicate responses and ensures smooth handover to a human agent.

- **Enable/Disable:** Toggle follow-ups to activate automated lead engagement
- **Follow-up Period:** Set the time interval (in hours) between follow-up messages
