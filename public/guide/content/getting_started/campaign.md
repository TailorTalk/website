# TailorTalk Campaign Guide  
  
TailorTalk's campaign feature empowers you to efficiently reach multiple leads via personalized WhatsApp messages. Simply upload your contact list and choose your preferred messaging method to create engaging outbound campaigns.  
  
## Step 1: Uploading Your Contact File  
  
Start by uploading your contacts in an Excel (.xlsx) or CSV file format. Ensure your file includes the following format:  
  
| contact     | name (optional) | city (optional) | business (optional) |  
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|  
| 919876543210 | John Doe        | New York        | Real Estate         |  
| 918765432109 | Alice Ray       | London          | E-commerce          |  
  
- **Mandatory Columns:** Include the `contact` column to ensure messages can be sent successfully.  
- **Optional Columns:** Add extra columns such as `name`, `city`, `business`, or any other custom fields to personalize messages effectively.  

## Step 2: Choosing Your Message Type  
  
TailorTalk gives you two ways to send your campaign messages:  
  
### Option A: Using Pre-Approved Templates  
  
You can use existing WhatsApp-approved message templates. Simply select `Template` and pick the desired template from the dropdown.  
  
- To create a new template, click `Create new template` and design your message from the WhatsApp Manager. Templates must be approved by WhatsApp before use.  
- **Important:** Ensure you do NOT include any variables in your selected template, as variables are currently unsupported.

### Option B: Using AI-Generated Prompt Messages  
  
Alternatively, you can create custom messages using the `Prompt` option. Simply enter your prompt describing how you wish to communicate with the leads. TailorTalk's intelligent sales and support agent will craft personalized messages based on your prompt. If your contact file includes additional columns such as age, city, or other attributes, the agent will automatically incorporate these details to create highly personalized messages for each recipient.
  
- After entering your prompt, click `Preview` to see exactly how your message will appear to each recipient.  
- Messages generated through this option will automatically comply with WhatsApp guidelines and will be categorized as either marketing or utility based on your prompt content.

- **Schedule for Later:** Click the `Now` button to open the calendar scheduling tool, where you can select a future date and time to automatically send your campaign.

## Campaign Dashboard: Monitor Your Results  
  
TailorTalk's intuitive Campaign Dashboard helps you effortlessly track the performance of your WhatsApp campaigns. Here, you can quickly view key metrics such as the total number of recipients, delivered messages, and detailed campaign statuses.
