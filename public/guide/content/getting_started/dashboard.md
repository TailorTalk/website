# Leads Dashboard

The **Leads Dashboard** is the central hub where you can view, manage, and interact with all leads in your system. It provides an overview of lead details, statuses, and their latest interactions.

## Features of the Leads Dashboard

### 1. Lock Lead
Leads can be locked to prevent the AI agent from responding to them automatically. This is useful in cases where human intervention is required, or when a lead should no longer be engaged.

- **How to Lock a Lead:** Select the checkbox next to a lead and click on the lock icon. This will prevent further automated messages to that lead.
- **Why Use This?** If a lead requires specific handling, locking prevents unwanted AI responses.

### 2. Message Lead
You can manually send messages to leads by clicking on their contact number. This opens the chatbox where you can directly communicate with the lead.
