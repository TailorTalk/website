## Step 1: Write Clear Agent Instructions  
The first step is to clearly define how you want your TailorTalk AI agent to interact with customers. Write specific and detailed instructions for the agent to follow.  
  
**Best practices for writing instructions:**  
- Clearly state your agent's role (e.g., a saree salesperson, product expert, customer support).  
- Define exactly how the agent should respond to customer queries.  
- Specify actions the agent should take when customers share images or product codes.  
- Mention how the agent should handle payments and transactions.  
  
  
## Step 2: Test Your Agent in the Chatbox  
After entering instructions, test your agent's responses using the interactive chatbox located on the right side of your dashboard.  
  
**How to test:**  
- Type a query in the chatbox and observe the agent’s responses.  
- If the agent's replies are incorrect or incomplete, refine your instructions accordingly.  
  
**Additional chatbox controls:**  
- Use the **Reset** button to clear conversations and test afresh.  
- Use the **Undo** button to remove the previous message and try again.  
  
## Step 3: Deploy Your Agent to Production  
Once you're satisfied with the agent's performance, click the **green 'Deploy' button**. Your updated instructions will immediately become active for real customers.  
  
**Important:** Always double-check your instructions and test thoroughly before deployment, as changes will affect live user interactions.  
  
## Step 4: Configure Follow-up Instructions (Optional)  
You have the option to define specific follow-up guidelines to enhance your agent’s conversational efficiency.  
  
- Write your custom follow-up instructions clearly below the main agent instructions.  
- If you leave this blank, the agent will automatically manage follow-ups smartly based on its built-in AI capabilities.  
  
**Testing follow-up instructions:**  
- Use the **Follow-up** button in the chatbox to simulate agent-initiated follow-up messages.  
  
## Step 5: Regularly Update and Optimize Your Agent  
Regularly monitor customer interactions and update your agent instructions to improve user experience and conversions continually.
