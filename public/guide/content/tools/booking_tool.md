<!-- ## Configuring the Booking Tool

1.  **Connect Your Google Calendar**: Use Google OAuth to securely add your desired calendars. This standard authentication method ensures your calendar data is handled safely.
2.  **Assign Calendar Labels**: After connecting, you can assign descriptive labels to each calendar. This helps your agent identify the correct calendar for specific tasks. For example:
    *   `ceo@tailortalk.ai` → "CEO's primary calendar"
    *   `sales-team@company.com` → "Sales team demo calendar" -->

## Enabling Your TailorTalk Agent to Access Your Calendar
