## Configuring the Booking Tool
1. **Enter Calendar ID**: Enter Gmail ID associated with the calendar. This tells your TailorTalk agent which calendar to use.
2. **Assign Calendar Labels**: You can define which calendar corresponds to which function. For example:
   - `ceo@tailortalk.ai` → "CEO calendar"
   - `cbo@gmail.com` → "CBO calendar"

## Sharing Calendar with Your TailorTalk Agent
