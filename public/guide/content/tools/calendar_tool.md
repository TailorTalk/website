# Calendar Tool

The **Calendar Tool** allows users to integrate single or multiple calendars with their AI agent. Once integrated, the agent can efficiently manage appointments and bookings, streamlining scheduling processes for various use cases.

## Configuring the Calendar Tool
1. **Enter Calendar ID**: Enter Gmail ID associated with the calendar. This tells the agent which calendar to use.
2. **Assign Calendar Labels**: You can define which calendar corresponds to which function. For example:
   - `ceo@tailortalk.ai` → "CEO calendar"
   - `cbo@gmail.com` → "CBO calendar"

## Sharing Your Calendar
To enable the agent to manage appointments, users need to share their calendar with the Tailortalk. Follow these steps:
1. Go to **Calendar Settings**.

- It can schedule on user inputs.
