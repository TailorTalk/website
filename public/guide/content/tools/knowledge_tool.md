# Knowledge Tool

The **Knowledge Tool** allows users to upload website URLs and documents to enhance the AI agentâ€™s knowledge base. Instead of dumping everything into a prompt, which can be inefficient and cluttered, this tool helps store detailed information separately. This way, the agent can access relevant data when needed.

## Uploading Data
Users can upload their data in two ways:
1. **Website URL:** Provide a website link containing relevant information.
2. **Documents:** Upload one or multiple files such as FAQs, guides, manuals, or product catalogs.

## Adding a Description
In the **Description** field, users can specify what the uploaded documents or website contain. This helps the agent understand the context and retrieve relevant answers when responding to leads.

## Example Use Cases
- Upload an FAQ document so the agent can answer common customer questions.
- Provide a product manual to assist leads with detailed product inquiries.

By using the **Knowledge Tool**, businesses can ensure their AI assistant has access to detailed information.
