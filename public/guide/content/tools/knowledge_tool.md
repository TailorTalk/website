# Knowledge Tool

The **Knowledge Tool** allows you to enhance your TailorTalk AI agent's knowledge base by uploading website URLs and documents. Instead of cluttering the prompt with detailed information, this tool helps your TailorTalk agent store and access relevant data efficiently when interacting with leads.

## Uploading Data to Your TailorTalk Agent
Users can upload their data in two ways:
1. **Website URL:** Provide a website link containing information for your TailorTalk agent to reference.
2. **Documents:** Upload one or multiple files such as FAQs, guides, manuals, or product catalogs for your TailorTalk agent to use.

## Adding Description for Your TailorTalk Agent
In the **Description** field, specify what the uploaded documents or website contain. This helps your TailorTalk agent understand the context and retrieve relevant answers when responding to leads.

## Example Use Cases
- Upload an FAQ document so your TailorTalk agent can answer common customer questions.
- Provide a product manual to assist your TailorTalk agent with detailed product inquiries.

By using the **Knowledge Tool**, businesses can ensure their AI assistant has access to detailed information.
