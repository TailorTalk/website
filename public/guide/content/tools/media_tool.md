- **Label:** Assign a label describing the media file (e.g., "room or tent pics," "food pics," "event brochure") to help your TailorTalk agent identify and use them appropriately.
- **Description:** Define how your TailorTalk agent should share the media (e.g., "If the user does not request a specific image, share all available media").
