# What are tools

tools are powerful extensions that enhance the capabilities of your AI agent, enabling it to perform various actions beyond simple responses. These tools allow the agent to fetch and present information, share media, manage calendars, process payments, and more. By integrating tools like Query, Media, Calendar, and Payment, the agent becomes more efficient in handling tasks, automating workflows, and providing seamless interactions. With the right tools, the agent can execute real-world actions, improving customer engagement and driving business outcomes.
