Unlike basic API platforms, TailorTalk utilizes built-in tools for tasks like booking and payments, performs sophisticated actions like contextual lead follow-ups, integrates deeply with your other business systems via API for custom tasks, and simplifies setup through natural language â€“ focusing on intelligent automation rather than just basic messaging connectivity."
